		question: 'What is Nocta UI?',
		answer:
			'A React component library built on a copy-paste philosophy. Instead of installing packages, you get clean, accessible source code - added straight to your project via the CLI.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Is Nocta UI accessible?',
		answer:
			'Yep. Accessibility isn’t an afterthought here. Components are built on top of @ariakit/react, so focus, keyboard navigation, and ARIA are all taken care of.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can I customize the components?',
		answer:
			'Completely. Since everything lives in your codebase, you can tweak styles, behavior, or structure however you want - no overrides or weird hacks.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Does Nocta UI work with my framework?',
		answer:
			'If you’re using React - absolutely. It’s optimized for Next.js, Vite, Tanstack Start and React Router, and the CLI auto-detects your setup so you can start fast.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What kind of support is available?',
		answer:
			'You’ll find clear documentation, usage guides, and examples on the official website. Issues and feedback are welcome on GitHub.',
	},
