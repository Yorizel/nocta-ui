	{
		question: 'What is Nocta UI?',
		answer:
			'Nocta UI is a React component library built with a copy-paste philosophy. Instead of shipping as a package, it provides source code you add directly to your project via a CLI.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Is Nocta UI accessible?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Accessibility is a core principle of Nocta UI. Interactive components are built on top of @ariakit/react, ensuring proper focus management, keyboard navigation, and WAI-ARIA compliance.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can I customize the components?',
		answer:
			'Absolutely. Since components are copied into your project, you have full control to adjust styling, behavior, or structure however you like.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Does Nocta UI work with my framework?',
		answer:
			'Yes. It is React-focused and optimized for Next.js, Vite and React Router projects. The CLI automatically detects your framework and configures everything for you.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What kind of support is available?',
		answer:
			'You can find clear documentation, usage guides, and examples on the official website. Contributions and issue tracking are available on GitHub.',
	},
