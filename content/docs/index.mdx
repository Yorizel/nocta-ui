title: Introduction
description: Nocta UI is a React component library built with a copy-paste philosophy. Instead of shipping as a heavy package, it provides source code you add directly to your project. This gives you full control, easy customization, and no versioning headaches.

## Built on Ariakit

Interactive primitives (menus, dialogs, tabs, roving focus grids, and more) are built on top of <a href="https://ariakit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ariakit/react</a>, ensuring robust accessibility, keyboard navigation, and WAI-ARIA compliance out of the box.

## Getting Started

Install the CLI and add components to your project:

```bash lineNumbers title="Terminal"
npx nocta-ui init
npx nocta-ui add button card badge
```
