## Install & Explore

No global install is required - run commands with NPX and Node.js 18+. Prefer a one-time setup? Install globally with `npm install -g @nocta-ui/cli` and invoke the CLI anywhere via the `nocta-ui` command. The CLI pulls the latest component data from the Nocta registry, so make sure you have network access when you execute commands.

**Built for speed:** The CLI core is written in Rust with a lightweight JavaScript wrapper, delivering near-instant command execution and blazing-fast component installation.

```bash lineNumbers title="Terminal"
npx @nocta-ui/cli --help
```

```bash lineNumbers title="Terminal"
npm install -g @nocta-ui/cli
nocta-ui --help
```
</Step>

<Step>
## Initialize Your Project

Set up configuration, Tailwind tokens, and baseline utilities in one step. The initializer validates your framework (Next.js, Vite + React, or React Router 7), ensures Tailwind CSS v4 is present, installs required runtime packages, and creates `nocta.config.json` tailored to your project layout.

```bash lineNumbers title="Terminal"
npx @nocta-ui/cli init
# Preview without changes
npx @nocta-ui/cli init --dry-run
```
</Step>

<Step>
## Discover Components

Browse the registry directly from your project. Components are grouped by category with descriptions, variants, and size information so you can decide what to install.

```bash lineNumbers title="Terminal"
npx @nocta-ui/cli list
```
</Step>

<Step>
## Add UI Building Blocks

Install one or many components at once. The CLI resolves internal dependencies, writes files into the alias defined by `nocta.config.json`, normalizes imports (`@/` or `~/`), and installs any missing npm packages. If target files already exist, you will be asked whether to overwrite them.

```bash lineNumbers title="Terminal"
npx @nocta-ui/cli add button card badge
# Preview without changes
npx @nocta-ui/cli add button --dry-run
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Command Reference

### `init`
```bash lineNumbers title="Terminal"
npx @nocta-ui/cli init
# Preview without changes
npx @nocta-ui/cli init --dry-run
```

- Detects supported frameworks: Next.js (App or Pages Router), Vite + React, or React Router 7 (Framework Mode)
- Requires Tailwind CSS v4 and optionally upgrades guidance if an older version is found
- Writes `nocta.config.json` with defaults for `tailwind.css`, component, and utility aliases
- Downloads shared utilities (`lib/utils.ts`) and base `icons.ts` from the registry
- Injects Nocta design tokens into the configured Tailwind CSS entry file (`@import "tailwindcss"` is preserved)
- Installs core dependencies: `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `class-variance-authority`, `@ariakit/react`, `@radix-ui/react-icons`
- Rolls back created files if initialization fails partway through

### `list`
```bash lineNumbers title="Terminal"
npx @nocta-ui/cli list
```
- Fetches the live component catalog from `https://nocta-ui.com/registry`
- Prints categories with descriptions and every component's summary
- Shows available variants and sizes where provided
- Suggests `npx @nocta-ui/cli add <name>` for quick follow-up installation

### `add <components...>`
```bash lineNumbers title="Terminal"
npx @nocta-ui/cli add button card dialog
# Preview without changes
npx @nocta-ui/cli add button --dry-run
```
- Requires a valid `nocta.config.json` generated by `init`
- Accepts multiple component names; nested dependencies are fetched automatically
- Normalizes import aliases to `@/` (Next.js, Vite, Tanstack Start) or `~/` (React Router 7)
- Prompts before overwriting existing files in your component folder
- Installs missing npm dependencies and reports satisfied or updated versions
- Prints created file paths plus ready-to-copy import statements, variants, and size options
- Supports `--dry-run` to preview all file writes and dependency changes without modifying the project

## Performance

The Nocta CLI is engineered for maximum speed. Its core is written in **Rust**, providing native-level performance for file operations, dependency resolution, and registry parsing. A thin JavaScript wrapper ensures seamless integration with npm and Node.js tooling while maintaining the blazing-fast execution times you'd expect from a compiled binary.

## Configuration

`nocta.config.json` controls where files are written, which CSS file receives design tokens, and how import aliases are prefixed. Edit it if your project uses custom folders or alias conventions.

```json lineNumbers title="nocta.config.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://nocta-ui.com/registry/config-schema.json",
  "style": "default",
  "tailwind": {
    "css": "app/globals.css"
  },
  "aliases": {
    "components": "components",
    "utils": "lib/utils"
  },
  "aliasPrefixes": {
    "components": "@",
    "utils": "@"
  }
}
```

- Next.js App Router defaults to `app/globals.css`, `components/ui`, and `lib/utils`
- Next.js Pages Router uses `styles/globals.css`, `components/ui`, and `lib/utils`
- Vite + React resolves to `src/App.css`, `src/components/ui`, and `src/lib/utils`
- Tanstack Start resolves to `src/styles.css`, `src/components/ui`, and `src/lib/utils`
- React Router 7 resolves to `app/app.css`, `app/components/ui`, and `app/lib/utils`
- Update `aliases.components` if you want files written somewhere else; the CLI always writes into `<alias>/`
- Update `aliasPrefixes` if you use custom import prefixes (for example `@ui` instead of `@/components`)

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- Tailwind CSS v4 must already be installed and present in `node_modules`
- React 18+ is expected; the dependency checker warns when required versions are missing or outdated
- The installer respects your package manager (`npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`) by detecting existing lockfiles

## Networking & Caching

- The registry, component source files, and design tokens are hosted remotely; commands need network access.
- Built-in caching reduces repeated network calls and enables offline fallback when possible:
  - Cache directory: `./.nocta-cache` (override with `NOCTA_CACHE_DIR`)
  - Default TTLs: registry 10 minutes, assets 24 hours (override via `NOCTA_CACHE_TTL_MS`, `NOCTA_ASSET_CACHE_TTL_MS`)
  - On network failure, the CLI falls back to the most recent cached content when available

## Troubleshooting

- Missing Tailwind CSS v4: install or upgrade with `npm i -D tailwindcss@latest` (or your package manager equivalent)
- Unsupported framework detected: ensure your project matches one of the supported frameworks or adjust structure so detection can succeed
- Component not found: run `npx @nocta-ui/cli list` to confirm the name, then try again

With the CLI in place you can script installations, scaffold component collections, and keep projects aligned with the latest Nocta UI releases without leaving your terminal.
